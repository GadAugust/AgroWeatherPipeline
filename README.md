# AgroWeatherPipeline
This project not only aims to cut overhead costs for Agro Farm but also enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of farm operations to weather changes. As a data engineer, my role is crucial in designing, implementing, and maintaining a robust, reliable, and scalable data pipeline that meets these objectives.
